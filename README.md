# film-junkie-union

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project evaluates different language learning models based on IMDB reviews and then uses a set of written reviews to compare the trained classification models.

        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        d) EDA
        e) Beginning of Machine Learning: Creating evaluation function
        f) Data Normalization
        g) Splitting the data
        i) Dummy model
        h) Machine learning models: NLTK, TF-IDF and LR, spaCy TF-IDF and LR, spaCy TF-IDF and LGBMClassifier, and BERT
        i) Testing with My Reviews
        j) Project conclusion

<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project will require Python 3.11.5 or later.

All packages required can be installed from the requirements.txt file by executing the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To run the Jupyter notebook, it can be downloaded from the repository (the main branch) and run in the IDE of your choice that can accommodate.

Please note that the data that was originally provided by the client and is proprietary. It is not available in this repository for that reason.

<h2>Plans for Updates</h2>

Upload the notebook to Google Colab to use GPU in order to test and run the code that is written for the BERT model.
