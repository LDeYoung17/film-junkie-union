# film-junkie-union

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project evaluates different language learning models based on IMDB reviews and then uses a set of written reviews to compare the trained classification models. 

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

1. Machine Learning Models (notebooks > ML.ipynb)
      
        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        d) EDA
        e) Beginning of Machine Learning: Creating evaluation function
        f) Data Normalization
        g) Splitting the data
        i) Dummy model
        h) Machine learning models: NLTK, TF-IDF and LR, spaCy TF-IDF and LR, spaCy TF-IDF and LGBMClassifier, and BERT
        i) Testing with My Reviews
        j) Project conclusion


<h2>Local Access</h2>

1. Make sure you are using Python version 3.11.5 locally
2. Make sure to have all the requirements in "requirements.txt" installed locally. 
3. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine 
4. Access the repository's main branch on your terminal. 
5. Open Jupyter Notebook using the platform of your choice
6. Set up a Jupyter kernel to use Python 3.11.5
7. Select "Run All"

<h2>Plans for Updates</h2>

Upload the notebook to Google Colab to use GPU in order to test and run the code that is written for the BERT model.
